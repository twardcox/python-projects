### what is this

This file is a compilation of projects I built while taking Rice College's Principles of Computing I & II courses through Coursera.

As Python requires an interpreter to be renedered on the browser all of this code uses CodeSkulptor as provided by the course.

### Projects and links

Because Python requires an interpreter I am providing a link to the code in CodeSkulptor. Please do not modify the code.

In 2048 you use the arrow keys to shift numbers up, down, left, right. When a number shifts next to another of the same value they merge together into a new number. You win if you get a value of 2048.
